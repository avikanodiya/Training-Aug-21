--You have been hired to create a relational database to support a car sales business. You need to store information on the businessâ€™s employees, inventory, and completed sales. You also need to account for the fact that each salesperson receives a different percentage of their sales in commission. What tables and columns would you create in your relational database, and how would you link the tables?

CREATE TABLE Employees
(
	EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,

	LastName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	PhoneNo NUMERIC(10) NOT NULL,
	Email VARCHAR(50),
	JoiningDate DATE NOT NULL,

CREATE TABLE Inventory

	CarID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	CarCompany VARCHAR(10),
	CarName VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	Stock INT NOT NULL,
	MRP INT NOT NULL,
	Discount INT
);

CREATE TABLE Sales
